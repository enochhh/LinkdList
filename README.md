# LinkdList

## What Is LinkdList?

LinkdList is essentially a bookmarks tool that organizes everything into one neat little window. It gives users the ability to save the URL of a tab and store it into a list that they can easily access at anytime. Users are also able to manually put in a link that they would like to add to the list. This list persists until the user decides they no longer need the links and deletes them.  

## Why'd I Call it LinkdList?
This extension is especially useful for jobseekers who are parsing through profiles and jobs on LinkedIn, trying to find the next opportunity (hence the name LinkdList). LinkdList gives users the ability to quickly scan through different job postings and profiles and save them to one spot. They can later go back and either apply to these jobs or send a message to reach out to a recruiter. 

## How Does It Help Users?
This alleviates the stress and chaos of job hunting by helping users split the workload, allowing them to search in one work session and apply/message recruiters in another. People tend to be more productive when they are focused on one task in a session as opposed to having to switch gears in the middle of a session. 

However, LinkdList can be used for everyday use, such as storing new recipes that you'd want to try out later or different vacation destinations you want to share with your special someone later in the evening :) Whatever the occasion, LinkdList is there to provide a convenient space to hold all your links!
