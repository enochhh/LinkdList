# LinkdList

LinkdList is a Chrome extension that essentially functions as a bookmark tool built with jobseekers in mind, specifically those looking for recruiters to connect with on LinkedIn. It provides users an easy way to store and access profiles of recruiters that they want to reach out to later on. 

Rather than having to copy and paste the profile URL to a doc, users can just save the URL with a click of a button using the extension. The user can then open up the extension to see all the previously saved URLS and remove the ones that are no longer needed.
